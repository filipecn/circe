# Circe

Circe is an open-source minimalist framework for the development of OpenGL based applications.  
Its users will spend time writing all the basic lines of code that appear in most graphics applications.

In principle, the framework should allow experienced users to control advanced features of OpenGL, 
while allowing less experienced users use it as well.

The basic idea is that you can resize up a graphical application with just few lines of code. 
Write only what is specific to your solution, leave the rest to Circe.
